      <h1>Using the browser Gamepad API with WAMP and Crossbar.io</h1>
      <p>
         This demo shows how to use the new <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/gamepad/raw-file/default/gamepad.html">W3C Gamepad API</a> to connect your gamepad to the cloud and devices via real-time messaging using 
         <a href="http://wamp.ws">WAMP</a> (which runs over WebSocket) and <a href="http://crossbar.io">Crossbar.io</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         This demo works best with Firefox, also Chrome, but no other browser currently (2014/11). To test support
         and basic operation of your gamepad (without any real-time messaging), you can checkout <a href="http://luser.github.io/gamepadtest/">this demo</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         Tested with Microsoft Xbox 360 wireless controller and PC wireless receiver.
         See <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/connections/xbox-360-wireless-gaming-receiver-windows">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         To test, open the <a href="monitor.html">Gamepad Monitor</a> in a first browser (on any PC).
      </p>
      <p>
         Then, on a second PC (where you gamepad is connected), open the <a href="gamepad.html">Gamepad Connector</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         You should see button presses and joystick movements being received in real-time in the first browser (and any
         other instances connected).
